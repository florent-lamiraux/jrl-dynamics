dynamics-JRLJapan 1.3.1 released July 6, 2007

	16. (oussama) Use the wrist joint in
	LinkBetweenJointsAndEndEffectorSemantic() instead of the hand
	joint.
	
dynamics-JRLJapan 1.3 released June 27, 2007

	15. Added separate doc and install-doc targets.
	14. skips comment lines in VRML files.
	13. fix bug in calculation of w and dq in
	DynamicMultiBody::FiniteDifferenceStateUpdate().

dynamics-JRLJapan 1.2 released June 14, 2007

	12. renamed hand related methods to wrist related methods
	(according to abstract interface).
	11. Implemented Hand (CjrlHand) and added attributes m_righthand
	and m_lefthand.
	10. Hard-coded HRP2's hands parallel- mechanism joint update in
	configuration
	9. Removed generated autotools files to avoid conflicts.

	8. Removed Makefile.in and configure from version control.
	7. Added @ROBOTDYNAMICS_CFLAGS@ and @ROBOTDYNAMICS_LIBS@ in unitTesting/Makefile.am
	One symbol is still undefined:
	undefined symbol: dgesvd_       (src/.libs/libdynamicsJRLJapan.so)
	6. Moved inclusion of MatrixAbstractLayer.h before other inclusion to make sure
	matrices and vectors are defined.
2007/03/07
	5. The use macros used in Body.h, DynamicBody.h, DynamicMultiBody.h,
	HumanoidDynamicMultiBody.h, Joint.h and MultiBody to define the matrix
	and vector used have been replaced by the typedef: vectorN, matrixNxP,
	vector3d, matrix3d,vector4d and matrix4d.
	4. The templates have been removed to fit the abstract interface at the
	include, source and test files.
	3. Changed configure.ac in such a way that option --with-t3d without
	path provokes call to pkg-config.
	2. In CrjlJoint& HumanoidDynamicMultiBody::fixedJoint, removed
	const to fit the abstract interface.
	1. In CjrlJoint& HumanoidDynamicMultiBody::fixedJoint, removed
	const to fit the abstract interface.
