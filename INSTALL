Installation instructions for library dynamicsJRLJapan
------------------------------------------------------

--- Booststraping the sources.

This package must be compiled using the GNU build system.
If you downloaded a packaged archive, it comes with a bootstraped
compilation environment. See the next paragraph 'building the
sources'. If you are tracking the git repository, you have to boostrap
manually the source tree. This can be done by invoking, in the root
directory of the source tree, the autogen script:

./autogen.sh

Note that you should have autoconf>=2.59, automake>=1.8 and libtool>=1.5
for this to work. Once the autogen script has run successfuly, you can
build the sources.


--- Building the sources.

It is recommended that you build the sources in a separate build
directory. This prevent from poisoning your source tree with object files
and other architecture-dependent objects.

From the root of the source tree, you can

mkdir build
cd build
../configure [OPTIONS]
make

The configure script takes several options, see the output of
../configure --help for an exhaustive list. One option of importance is
--prefix=/path/to/install that specify that this package will be
installed in the "/path/to/install" directory.


--- Installing

Simply invoke the following command from the build directory:

make install

The package will be installed in the prefix you passed to configure, or
in /usr/local if you didn't specify any prefix.



Notes of linear algebra and rigid-body motion computations
----------------------------------------------------------

Linear algebra computations are performed either by ublas and lapack
or by VNL. 
Rigid-body motion computations are performed either by a default ad-hoc
implementation or by t3d.

The choice of which package for which computation is done when
configuring MatrixAbstractLayer package.
