See INSTALL for installation instruction.

The main goal of the recent modifications is a strict compliance
to abstractDynamics.
Therefore any code relying on direct access to dynamicsJRLJapan's old
structures will not compile with this new version.

Moreover, this version includes a normalization of all the joint
to revolute around the x-axis. This implies a modification of all the
local frames.

Finally they are some modifications on the parser which allow
to get geometrical information on the parsed robot model.
Depending on the transformation applied to the VRML files
you might have to compensate for some local rotation
(for instance the left grippers of HRP-2 10 & 14).
The parser provides the rotation on the local frames to
compensate for those transformations.
In tools, you can find a program called CreateVRMLPoseFile.
It takes the usual files plus an additional one specifying
the pose of the robot. From those files, it generates a VRML file
that can be imported in Blender.
